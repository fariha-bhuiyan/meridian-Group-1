# Meridian Books

The online shop for Meridian Books, an independent bookseller. This is the starter application for **LD6049 DevOps Principles**.

Your group works as DevOps consultants for Meridian. Right now the shop is built, tested and released by hand. Over the module you'll build a CI/CD pipeline around this code.

## What it does

- Lists books, with a genre filter
- Adds books to a basket
- Works out the basket total, with 10% off when you buy 3 or more books

## Run it

You need **Node.js 22 or later** and **Git**.

```bash
git clone <this repository's URL>
cd meridian-books
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

To use a different port:

```bash
PORT=4000 npm start
```

Stop the app with `Ctrl + C`.

## Run the tests

npm test
```
